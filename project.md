# Project ([**P**ARA](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/))

You have __projects__ you’re actively working on – short-term
efforts (in your work or personal life) that you take on
with a certain goal in mind.

My projects fall into generally four areas.

## God

### Book Study
* Nov 2, 9, 16, 30
* Jan 4 Thursdays
* Mar 4 Thursdays
* Max Lucado. [_You Are Never Alone_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400217377).

## Family

## Church

### DCOM paperwork

* Due 10/31. Make sure you upload your required Local Pastor
documentation to your Passage profile (under ‘Journey of a
Local Pastor) for this meeting. Try to get that done by
Nov. 1st.  Let me know if you need help doing that.  --_Rev. Mary M. Brady_

### MD Bulletin

* Use MD as a single source from which we generate 
HTML, PDF, and any other thing we need.
* This might be longer-term than "Project" implies. 

### Financial documents

* Audit
* Review of controls & reports
