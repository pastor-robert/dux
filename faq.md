# FAQ

## Who?

My name is Rob Adams. In rough order I am:

### A Child of God

There are two things that I accept as axiomatic in my life. 

1. God is God.

2. God loves me.

From these axioms, under the guidance of the Holy Spirit and
the wisdom of the Bible, I derive everything else.

Paul the Apostle wrote words that have guided through good times and bad:

> 35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? ...
37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. 38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[k] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.
	_Romans 8:35-38 (NIV)_

God is God, and God loves me.

### Husband, Parent, and Son

Remind me later to tell you about my family.

### A United Methodist Pastor

I pastored the Sadorus and Parkville United Methodist Churches from 2010-2020
(the firt two years as a lay pastor; I was licensed in 2012).

I am currently the pastor at Mt Vernon UMC (Champaign) and Bellflower UMC.

### A Computer Programmer

I have been coding professionally (in the sense of having a full-time job)
since 1984. Even prior to that, I was getting paid to code as far back as 1979.

I have written web applications. I have worked on desktop applications.
I have written models for a electronic-design simultor.
I co-wrote an embedded real-time OS. I have written device drivers.
I wrote a web server and a web client.

I could go on, but I've made my point. I've worked in lot of areas
in computer programming, but truly mastered none.
